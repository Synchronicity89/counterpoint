# Counterpoint Composer
Creates first-species modal counterpoint that follows conventional voice-leading rules.

A cantus firmus is created, and then a counterpoint melody is tried above it. If no solution is found, a new cantus firmus is created, and the process begins again. 

## Forthcoming
This will eventually be able to do other species counterpoint as well as free counterpoint. Either this module or another will include machine-learning that trains on actual musical scores and follows the practice. Check back for more updates.
